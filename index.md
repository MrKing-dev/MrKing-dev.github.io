## Web Design and Javascript

[Dice Breaker](http://www.grekinstudios.com/dice_breaker_online)

*This was a website a created with basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript to support a roleplaying game I was running for my students. Being able to roll any amount of dice with a number of RPG-friendly options while working remotely was very useful for us (it can roll nearly a billion dice!).*

[Luft Duck](https://www.grekinstudios.com/luft_duck/)

*I get chronic migraines, which are triggered by barometric pressure changes.  I have never found a site or app that shows those changes the way I wanted to see them, so I decided to create my own!  This project was create using intermediate HTML, CSS, and Javascript as I was learning in my courses on Codecademy.  I specifically wanted to learn how to do API calls and how to display data well. --Note: This application was previously published under a different name, but I shared it on a forum and it received so much attention that I was locked out of my APIs for a time. I have since changed the name and made the repository private (the name comes from the German "Luftdruck" which means simply "Barometric Pressure."*
